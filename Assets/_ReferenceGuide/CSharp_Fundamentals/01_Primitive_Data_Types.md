# ðŸŸ¢ Primitive Data Types

### int

**Meaning:** An individual number (whole number, no decimals).  
**Example:**

```csharp
int damage = 5;  // Damage will do a total of 5
```

**When to use it:**  
When you need to store or calculate a solid number like health, score, or item count.

---

### float

**Meaning:** A number that can include decimals.  
**Example:**

```csharp
float speed = 3.5f;  // Player moves at 3.5 units per second
```

**When to use it:**  
For measurements that require precision, like movement speed, time, or distance.

---

### double

**Meaning:** A larger and more precise version of a float.  
**Example:**

```csharp
double playerAccuracy = 99.9999;
```

**When to use it:**  
When you need very precise decimal numbers (rare in most Unity projects).

---

### string

**Meaning:** A group of text characters.  
**Example:**

```csharp
string playerName = "Ryan";
```

**When to use it:**  
Whenever you need to store or display words, sentences, or names.

---

### bool

**Meaning:** A true or false value.  
**Example:**

```csharp
bool isJumping = false;
```

**When to use it:**  
When something can only have two states, like on/off, open/closed, alive/dead.

---

### char

**Meaning:** A single text character (not a full word).  
**Example:**

```csharp
char grade = 'A';
```

**When to use it:**  
When you only need one letter or symbol, not an entire string.
